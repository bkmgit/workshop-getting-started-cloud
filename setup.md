title: Setup
---

Before you start this lesson, we recommend that you make sure you have a SSH client.
Under Mac OS, you can use the Terminal application that comes pre-installed. On Linux you can use any terminal emulator as well, as
long as you have the `ssh` command, which is available on any sane
Linux distribution.
On Windows, for working remotely you can consider installing [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).

Furthermore, it is useful to have an application that can transfer files to a remote computer, although this is not needed for the workshop. For example, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)
or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Windows only).

During this workshop, access to a cloud instance will be provided where workshop participants can connect to via these application
and work remotely using the shell of the cloud instance.

More detailed information can be found in the [third episode](03-connecting).
