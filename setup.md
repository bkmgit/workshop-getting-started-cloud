title: Setup
---

Before you start this lesson, we recommend that you make sure you have a SSH client.
Under Mac OS, you can use the Terminal application that comes pre-installed. On Linux you can use any terminal emulator as well.
On Windows, I personally recommend installing [Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
Furthermore, it is useful to have an application that can transfer files to a remote computer. For example, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)
or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) (Windows only).

During this workshop, access to a cloud instance will be provided where workshop participants can connect to via these application
and work remotely using the shell of the cloud instance.
