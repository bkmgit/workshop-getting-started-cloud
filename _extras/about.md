## About this Workshop

This workshop was designed for a very short workshop aimed at
students in Econometrics at Erasmus University Rotterdam.

The materials in this workshop are partly based on existing materials
from the [Introduction to Using the Shell in a High-Performance Computing Context](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/), and partly
created for the intended audience.

This workshop and the adjusted materials are in no way endorsed or part of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), even though their software was used to create these
materials. They are kind enough to share their teaching material and
software to create it under the [CC-BY 4.0 and MIT licenses](../LICENSE.html), which helps a lot in creating custom workshop materials.
