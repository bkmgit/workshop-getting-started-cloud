In this workshop we will get you started working with remote computers running in the cloud.
The remote computer we work with will be controlled using a command-line interface, and
therefore we will give a brief introduction on working with the command-line, also called
a *shell*. The most common shell is the Unix shell, which is part of Mac OS and Linux out
of the box, and can be added to Windows via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
After we connect to a remote server via the *secure shell protocol* SSH, we go through
part of a [workshop on using the shell in a High-Performance Computing Content](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/).
Then we discuss how to prepare your own programs written in Python, R or Java such that they
can be easily executed from the shell. Finally, we discuss how we can make sure programs
that take long to run keep running when we disconnect, and how we can schedule a program
to run at particular times.
