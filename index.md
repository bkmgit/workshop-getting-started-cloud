In this workshop we will get you started working with remote computers running in the cloud.
The remote computer we work with will be controlled using a command-line interface, and
therefore we will give a brief introduction on working with the command-line, also called
a *shell*. The most common shell is the Unix shell, which is part of Mac OS and Linux out
of the box, and can be added to Windows via the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).
After we connect to a remote server via the *secure shell protocol* SSH, we go through a
small part of a longer [workshop on the Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
Finally, we discuss how to prepare your own programs written in Python, R or Java such that they
can be easily executed from the shell.

## Original Introduction

The Unix shell has been around longer than most of its users have been alive.
It has survived so long because it's a power tool
that allows people to do complex things with just a few keystrokes.
More importantly,
it helps them combine existing programs in new ways
and automate repetitive tasks
so they aren't typing the same things over and over again.
Use of the shell is fundamental to using a wide range of other powerful tools
and computing resources (including "high-performance computing" supercomputers).
These lessons will start you on a path towards using these resources effectively.


> ## Prerequisites
>
> This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the
> shell.  If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize
> the word "file" and either "directory" or "folder" (two common words
> for the same thing), you're ready for this lesson.
